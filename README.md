# Dart TCP Sockets Example

Simple example of server-client, TCP-based socket communication, supporting bidirectional communication and multiple
client connections.

This isn't a library or wrapper â€” it is just a basic example in Dart.

## Running the example

```shell
# start the server first:
dart main.dart

# then start the client(s):
dart main.dart client
```
